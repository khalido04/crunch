-Tells crunch to generate words that don't have repeating characters.  By default crunch will generate a wordlist size of #of_chars_in_charset ^ max_length.  This option will instead generate #of_chars_in_charset!.  The ! stands for factorial.  For example say the charset is abc and max length is 4..  Crunch will by default generate 3^4 = 81 words.  This option will instead generate 3! = 3x2x1 = 6 words (abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba).  THIS MUST BE THE LAST OPTION!  This option CANNOT be used with -s and it ignores min and max length however you must still specify two numbers.
